    <xs:annotation>
      <xs:documentation>Image_Display_Geometry class provides an
        unambiguous description of the orientation of the image
        contents. Given an image, displayed as described by the
        Display_Direction class, any one of the Object_Orientation_*
        classes should allow unambiguous orientation of the contents of
        the image. The Local_Internal_Reference class is used to
        identify the object to which this instance of the
        Image_Display_Geometry class applies, and must be used if there
        is more than one instance of Image_Display_Geometry in the
        label. The appropriate value for local_reference_type is
        image_display_to_object. The Object_Orientation_North_East class
        is typically used for instruments for which the entire field of
        view is a portion of the target surface (e.g., instruments on
        Mars orbital spacecraft); otherwise use
        Object_Orientation_RA_Dec (e.g., flyby missions, missions with
        orbit radii much larger than the target radius such as Voyager
        or Cassini). At least one of these must be used. The two
        *_Identification classes used here are Central_Body (e.g.,
        Saturn if you are using Planetocentric or planetographic
        coordinates in the Saturn system) and Target when the described
        object in the FoV is not the Central_Body. For example giving
        the orientation of the pole of Enceladus in Saturn
        Planetocentric coordinates, Central_Body = Saturn, Target =
        Enceladus. Bottom line: put in enough information so someone
        else can figure out the orientation of the field of view. We
        also offer an option to provide the pointing information as a
        quaternion. </xs:documentation>

  <xs:complexType name="Quaternion_Base">
    <xs:annotation>
      <xs:documentation>The Quaternion_Base class defines a quaternion
        that represents rotation between two right-handed reference
        frames. In this dictionary, quaternions are always constructed
        so that the application of the quaternion describes the rotation
        of one frame to a second frame. The two frames and the direction
        of rotation must be identified unambiguously in the enclosing
        classes. Quaternions are expressed as a set of four numbers in
        the order (qcos, qsin1, qsin2, qsin3), where qcos = cos(theta/2)
        and qsin(n) = sin(theta/2)*a(n). Theta is the angle of rotation
        and a is the unit vector (x,y,z) around which the rotation
        occurs. A document providing the full mathematical basis for
        this construction, along with examples, and a summary of common
        pitfalls, is in preparation. The current version can be obtained
        by contacting the PDS Engineering Node. In application you need
        to know the four elements of the quaternion, the two end point
        frames, and the direction of the rotation. This dictionary
        provides two extensions to this Base class. In the
        Quaternion_Plus_Direction class we require the direction of
        rotation. This class can only be used if the two end point
        frames are identified in the enclosing class. This is generally
        the case in the Lander section. The Quaternion_Plus_To_From
        class requires the two frames be identified explicitly with one
        designated as the "from frame" and the other as the "to frame".

      <xs:documentation>The Vector_Vertical is a composite vector
        encoding three quantities: V' (a vector in the image plane
        perpendicular to the horizontal rows), Vs (the distance between
        the lens center and image plane, measured in vertical pixels),
        and Vc (the vertical image coordinate directly under C when
        moving parallel to A). V' is often thought of as describing the
        orientation of columns in space, but is actually perpendicular
        to the rows. </xs:documentation>

    <xs:annotation>
      <xs:documentation>The instrument_elevation attribute specifies the
        value for an instrument's rotation in the vertical direction. It
        may be usually measured from a low hard stop, or relative to a
        coordinate frame. Although it may be used for any instrument
        where it makes sense, it is primarily intended for use in
        surface-based instruments that measure pointing in terms of
        azimuth and elevation. If this value is expressed using a
        coordinate system, the coordinate system is specified by the
        Coordinate_Space_Reference class. The interpretation of exactly
        what part of the instrument is being pointed is
        mission-specific. It could be the boresight, the camera head
        direction, the CAHV camera model A vector direction, or any of a
        number of other things. As such, for multimission use this value
        should be used mostly as an approximation, e.g. identifying
        scenes that might contain a given object. </xs:documentation>
