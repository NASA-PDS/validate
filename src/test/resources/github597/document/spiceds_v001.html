Overview
========

   This archive includes the complete set of the Mars 2020 Perseverance 
   Rover Mission data files (kernel files), which can be accessed using
   SPICE software. The SPICE data contain geometric and other ancillary
   information needed to recover the full value of science instrument
   data. In particular SPICE kernels provide spacecraft and planetary
   ephemerides, spacecraft and instrument orientation, instrument
   mounting alignments, and data needed for relevant time conversions.
   Data in the SPICE kernel files must be accessed using the software
   called the SPICE Toolkit produced and distributed by the Navigation
   and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) Node of the Planetary Data
   System.

   This archive includes data covering from Mars 2020 launch, 2020-07-30,
   through the end time of the latest rover surface traverse position SPK 
   file supplied in the archive. Until the end of the spacecraft lifespan 
   this archive will be accumulating with new data added according to the 
   project archiving plan.

Errata
======

   1. This document is a simple HTML document. Providing documents in a
      simple mark-up format was allowed by earlier versions of the PDS4
      Standards but became prohibited in later versions starting summer
      2015. Since using HTML documents was compliant at the time when a
      similar document was first provided in the MAVEN PDS4 archive and
      since NAIF strives to make bundle description document format and
      style consistent across all archives, this document continues
      to exist in this archive as an HTML document.
    
   2. The XML labels of the ancillary products have the reference_type
      attribute of the Internal_Reference association within the
      Reference_List class of the Context_Area class pointing to the latest
      archive description document set to "ancillary_to_data" which is not
      correct. The correct value "ancillary_to_document" could not be used
      in these labels because it is not available in the PDS4 information
      model (IM) 1.5.0.0 used by this archive. This value was added to IM
      only in the version 1.14.0.0.  

   3. Only a partial structures IK with a few antenna FOVs is included. 
      IKs for other instruments may be added in a future release.

   4. The Mars 2020 FK does not define frames for majority of instruments. 
      A more complete FK may be added in a future release.

   5. RSM and RA orientation CKs have sparse coverage. CKs with more
      complete coverage may be added in a future release.

   6. No HGA CK is included. HGA CK for initial 90 Sols may be added in a
      future release.
      
   7. No Helicopter Technology Demonstration Ingenuity kernels are included. 
      SPK, CKs, IKs, and FK updates for the helicopter may be added in a 
      future release.

<A NAME="Kernel Types"></A>
Kernel Types
============

   Different SPICE kernel types are used to store different kinds of
   ancillary data.

   SPK (Spacecraft Planet Kernel) files contain ephemerides (position
   and velocity) for spacecraft, planets, satellites, comets and
   asteroids as well as for moving or fixed spacecraft and instrument
   structures. SPK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/spk/">spice_kernels/spk</a>
   directory of this archive.

   PCK (Planetary Constants Kernel) files contain certain physical,
   dynamical and cartographic constants for target bodies, such as size
   and shape specifications, and orientation of the spin axis and prime
   meridian. PCK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/pck/">spice_kernels/pck</a>
   directory of this archive.

   IK (Instrument Kernel) files contain instrument parameters relevant
   for computing an instrument's geometry such as field-of-view
   definitions, CCD and optical distortion characteristics, and internal
   timing parameters. IK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ik/">spice_kernels/ik</a>
   directory of this archive.

   CK (C-matrix Kernel) files contain time varying orientations for
   spacecraft, spacecraft structures, and articulating science
   instruments. CK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ck/">spice_kernels/ck</a>
   directory of this archive.

   LSK (Leapseconds Kernel) files contain the leapseconds and the
   values of other constants required to perform a transformation
   between Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) and Ephemeris time (ET),
   which is also known as Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB). LSK
   files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/lsk/">spice_kernels/lsk</a> directory of
   this archive.

   SCLK (Spacecraft Clock Kernel) files contain on-board clock
   calibration data required to perform a transformation between
   Ephemeris time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK). SCLK files
   are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/sclk/">spice_kernels/sclk</a> directory of this
   archive.

   FK (Frame definitions Kernel) files contain information required to
   define reference frames, sources of frame orientation data and
   connections between these frames and other frames supported within
   the SPICE system. The science instrument frame definitions provided
   in the FK files include mounting alignment information for the
   instruments. FK files are located under the <a href="../spice_kernels/fk/">spice_kernels/fk</a>
   directory of this archive.

   MK (Meta-Kernel) files list sets of related SPICE kernels that
   should be used together, providing an easy way to make data from
   these kernel sets available to a SPICE-based application by loading
   meta-kernels into the program using the high level SPICE data loader
   routine FURNSH. MK files are located the <a href="../spice_kernels/mk/">spice_kernels/mk</a>
   directory of this archive.

Archived Kernel Details
=======================

   The subsections below provide details, such as file naming
   conventions and specific details, for each of the kernel types
   included in this archive.

<p align="right"><a href="#Table of Contents">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>
<A NAME="SPK Files"></A>
SPK Files

   SPK (Spacecraft Planet Kernel) files contain ephemerides (position
   and velocity) for spacecraft, planets, satellites, comets and
   asteroids as well as for moving or fixed spacecraft and instrument
   structures.

   This archive includes binary SPK files containing the following
   kinds of ephemeris data:

      -  planetary ephemeris SPKs

            These SPKs contain ephemeris data for the Solar System
            planet barycenters, and Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and
            Moon, determined by the JPL Solar System Dynamics group and
            are named DEXXX, e.g. DE430.

      -  Martian satellite ephemeris SPKs

            These SPKs contain ephemeris data for Mars, Phobos, Deimos,
            Sun, Earth barycenter, and Earth, determined by the
            JPL Solar System Dynamics group and are named MARXXX, e.g.
            MAR097.

      -  reconstructed spacecraft cruise trajectory SPKs

            These SPKs contain the reconstructed Mars 2020 spacecraft
            trajectory for cruise determined by the Mars 2020 Navigation
            (NAV) team, JPL.

      -  reconstructed spacecraft EDL trajectory SPKs

            These SPKs contain the reconstructed Mars 2020 spacecraft
            trajectory during Entry Descent Landing (EDL) determined by
            the Mars 2020 EDL Team, JPL.

      -  actual landing site position SPKs

            These SPKs contain the actual location of the Mars 2020
            landing site in the Mars body-fixed frame (IAU_MARS,
            based on IAU 2000 Mars rotation constants), determined by
            the Mars 2020 EDL Team, JPL.
    
      -  rover at landing site position SPKs

            These SPKs contain the position of the Mars 2020 rover
            fixed at the landing site. These files were used during 
            operations by CHRONOS and other applications that were not 
            sensitive to the local rover movements.

      -  structures SPKs

            These SPKs contain fixed locations of of selected rover 
            structures and instruments such as Remote Sensing Mast (RSM), 
            Robotic Arm (RA), and cameras. The data included in the file 
            are based of dimensions from the spacecraft engineering drawings.

      -  localized rover path and site locations SPKs

            These SPKs contain the locations of the sites along the path 
            relative to the center of Mars and the location of the rover 
            relative to the center of Mars, created by the NAIF, JPL.

            These SPKs were created using localized data available in the
            PLACES server developed and maintained by the Mars 2020 Operations
            Product Generation Subsystem (OPGS) Team. The set of localized
            data in the PLACES server included rover and site location data
            for a limited set of localization points determined by tracing
            the rover traverse on high resolution maps, combined a subset
            of telemetry products to create a more complete set of location
            points. Because the telemetry products used in this process
            included only image headers and mobility summaries, containing
            rover location during non-motion periods, and did not include
            data from the high-rate mobility history products containing
            rover location during motion periods, these SPKs do not provide
            real data during motion but instead provide interpolated
            values.
    
            In global context the data provided in these SPKs is
            significantly more accurate than telemetered rover position
            estimated on-board. Because of this these SPKs should be
            preferred to the telemetry-based rover path SPKs.

      -  telemetry-tased rover path and site locations SPKs

            These SPKs contain the locations of the sites along the path 
            relative to the landing site and location of the rover relative 
            to these sites.

            These SPKs were created using telemetry data available in the
            PLACES server developed and maintained by the Mars 2020 Operations
            Product Generation Subsystem (OPGS) Team. The set of telemetry
            data in the PLACES server included rover and site location data
            from only a subset of telemetry products containing such
            information. Specifically, it included data from the product
            and image headers and mobility summaries, containing rover
            location during non-motion periods, and did not include data
            from the high-rate mobility history products containing rover
            location during motion periods. For this reason, these SPKs do
            not provide real data during motion but instead provide
            interpolated values.
    
            Because data provided in these SPKs is based on telemetered
            rover position estimated on-board, these SPKs are only as
            accurate as that estimate, which, depending on the traverse
            distances, slippage and sliding, can off by meters.

   The SPK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/spk/">spice_kernels/spk</a>
   directory and are named according to the following schemes:

      -  planetary ephemeris SPKs

               deVVVs.bsp

            where

               VVV       is the ephemeris version.

               s         (optional) indicates that the original file
                         coverage was shortened to reduce the file
                         size.

      -  Martian satellite ephemeris SPKs

               marVVVs.bsp

               s         (optional) indicates that the original file
                         coverage was shortened to reduce the file
                         size.

<A NAME="CK Files"></A>
CK Files

   CK (C-matrix Kernel) files contain time varying orientations for
   spacecraft, articulating spacecraft structures, and articulating
   science instruments.

   This archive includes binary CK files containing the following kinds
   of orientation data:

      -  reconstructed spacecraft cruise orientation CKs

            These CKs contain the reconstructed Mars 2020 spacecraft
            cruise attitude determined on-board and downlinked in
            spacecraft telemetry, determined by the Mars 2020 Attitude
            Control System (ACS) Team, JPL.
    
            The set of CKs provided by the Mars 2020 ACS Team includes a CK 
            with complete cruise orientation based on H-vector direction 
            without modeling spin, a CK with fully reconstructed orientation 
            based on real-time quaternions covering only communication periods, 
            a CK with high-rate high-accuracy orientation covering only a few
            very short periods during certain events sugh as: attitude 
            maneuvers, ACS calibration activities, or thruster firing events.

      -  reconstructed spacecraft EDL orientation CKs

            These CKs contain the reconstructed Mars 2020 spacecraft EDL
            attitude, from the EDL entry point to landing, determined
            by Mars 2020 EDL team, JPL.

      -  reconstructed rover surface orientation CKs

            These CKs contain the orientation of the rover relative to the 
            local level frame, created by NAIF, JPL.

            These CKs were created using telemetry data available in the
            PLACES server developed and maintained by the Mars 2020 OPGS Team.
            The set of telemetry data in the PLACES server included rover
            orientation data only from a subset of telemetry products
            containing such information. Specifically, it included data
            from the product and image headers and mobility summaries,
            containing rover orientation during non-motion periods, and did
            not include data from the high-rate mobility history products,
            containing rover orientation during motion periods. For this
            reason, these CKs do not provide real data during motion but
            instead provide interpolated values.
     
            Due to incomplete source data these CKs have gaps in coverage,
            which can be closed, if needed, using the CKSPANIT utility
            program.

      -  reconstructed articulating structures orientation CKs

            These CKs contain the orientation of the Remote Sensing Mast 
            (RSM), Robotic Arm (RA), and High Gain Antenna (HGA) relative 
            to the rover frame, created by NAIF, JPL.
            
            These CKs were created using telemetry data available in the
            PLACES server developed and maintained by the Mars 2020 OPGS Team.
            The set of telemetry data in the PLACES server included
            structure articulation angle data from only a subset of
            telemetry products containing such information. Specifically,
            it included data from the product and image headers and
            articulation summaries, containing structure articulation
            angles during non-articulation periods, and did not include
            data from the high-rate articulation history products,
            containing structure articulation angles during articulation
            periods. For this reason, these CKs do not provide real data
            during articulation but instead provide interpolated values.
            
            The sets of CKs for RSM and RA include CKs based on encoder
            angles (less accurate but more complete) and CKs based on
            resolver angles (more accurate but less complete).
            
            While RSM and HGA CKs based on resolver angles provide accurate
            orientation matching that computed in the flight software, the
            RA CKs do not because the simple forward kinematics approach
            implemented using these CKs and corresponding frame chains does
            not model flexing of the RA which can lead to end point
            orientation errors of a degree or more for some RA
            configurations.
            
            Due to incomplete source data these CKs have gaps in coverage,
            which can be closed, if needed, using the CKSPANIT utility
            program.
    
   The CK files are provided under the <a href="../spice_kernels/ck/">spice_kernels/ck</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

LSK Files

   LSK (Leapseconds Kernel) files contain the leapseconds and the
   values of other constants required to perform a transformation
   between Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) and Ephemeris time (ET),
   also known as Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB).

<A NAME="SCLK Files"></A>
SCLK Files

   SCLK (Spacecraft Clock Kernel) files contain on-board clock
   calibration data required to perform a mapping between Ephemeris
   time (ET) and spacecraft on-board time (SCLK).

   This archive includes text SCLK files containing the following kinds of
   data:
    
      - official Mars 2020 on-board clock correlation SCLKs
    
            These SCLKs contain a tabulation of data needed for converting 
            time measurements between ephemeris time (ET) and Mars 2020 
            spacecraft clock time (SCLK). They are made from similar
            files -- SCLK/SCET file, or SCLKvSCET file -- produced by
            mission Time Correlation Subsystem (TCS) team.
 
            The official on-board correlation SCLK files used in operations
            and included in this data set provide correlation that is
            incorrect in an absolute sense by as much as 3 seconds during
            surface operations. The main reason for this error is the loose
            time correlation requirement for surface operations intended
            to keep backward compatibility between correlation versions
            and minimize the impact of deployment of the new correlation
            across the ground data system.
   
    
      - improved Mars 2020 on-board clock correlation SCLKs
    
            These improved SCLK files contain on-board clock correlation
            accurate to a few tens of milliseconds or better, made
            specifically for archiving to fix large correlation errors 
            present in the official SCLKs.
    
      - Local Mean Solar Time (LMST) SCLKs    
    
            These SCLK files provide a way of converting between the Local
            Mean Solar Time (LMST) time system used during surface
            operations and other time systems. LMST was introduced as a
            replacement of the Local True Solar Time (LTST) because a time
            system with a constant duration of a second was needed for use
            in the planning and sequencing processes. The LMST is
            essentially a linear approximation of the local true solar time
            with the rate set equal to the mean Mars local second duration
            and the initial reference point set to LMST midnight of the
            landing SOL. Due to ellipticity of the Mars orbit this
            approximation is periodic and deviates from the LTST by as much
            as 50 minutes during Martian year.

MK Files

   Meta-kernel (MK) files (a.k.a 'furnsh' files) provide lists of the
   archived kernels included in this archive suitable for loading into
   a SPICE-based application via the high level SPICE data loader
   routine FURNSH. Using meta-kernels makes it easy to load with
   one call a comprehensive SPICE data collection for a given period.

   This archive includes the following kinds of MK files:

   workstation they can be loaded into a SPICE-based application
   directly from the directory in which they reside -- because the
   PATH_VALUES keyword is set to '..' and '/' is used as the path
   delimiter -- it is recommended that users make local copies of these
   files and update the PATH_VALUES keyword in each of them to point to
   the actual location of the archive's 'spice_kernels' directory on
   their system. Additional changes including replacing '/' and '\' in
   all path specifications and converting UNIX line terminators to
   terminators native to the user's system may be required to use these
   meta-kernels on non-UNIX workstation.

   The following guidelines were followed to pick and set priority --
   determined by the order in which the kernel files are listed, with
   the latest one taking precedence -- for the kernel files included in
   these meta-kernels:

      -  the latest archived versions of LSK, PCK, on-board clock and
         LMST SCLKs, IKs, FK, planetary ephemeris SPK, satellite
         ephemeris SPK, cruise SPK, EDL SPK and CK, landing site SPK,
         localized rover surface path SPK, and rover, RSM, RA, and HGA
         CKs were included
  
      -  only the reconstructed cruise CK based on real-time telemetry
         during communication periods was included.
    
   Additional description of the kernels sets listed in a text MK file is
   provided in metadata included inside the description area of the
   file. This information can be viewed using any text editor program.

Miscellaneous Files
===================
    
   Miscellaneous files provide value added elements that are outside the
   scope of the PDS archive requirements. Miscellaneous files included in 
   this archive are currently limited to checksum files.

   The subsection below provides details for these files.

<A NAME="Checksum Files"></A>
Checksum Files

   A checksum file provides a table of MD5 checksums for all files in the 
   archive as of a particular archive (bundle) version, including
   checksums for all previous checksums files and their labels but
   excluding the checksum for the checksum file itself and its label.

   The checksum files are provided under the <a href="../miscellaneous/checksum/">miscellaneous/checksum</a>
   directory and are named according to the following scheme:

      -  Mars 2020 checksum files

               checksum_vVVV.tab

            where

               VVV       is the version; the file with the latest
                         version supersedes all similarly named
                         files with earlier versions and can be
                         used to validate the archive in its
                         entirety.

File Formats
============

   All text documents, checksum files, and other meta information files 
   such as descriptions, detached PDS4 labels, and inventory tables, are 
   stream format files, with a carriage return (ASCII 13) and a line feed 
   character (ASCII 10) at the end of the records. This allows the files 
   to be read by most operating systems.

   The text kernel files in this archive -- LSKs, PCKs, SCLKs, IKs, FKs,
   and MKs -- are UNIX text files, with a line feed character (ASCII 10) 
   at the end of the line, and binary kernel files -- SPKs and CKs -- are 
   IEEE LSB binary files. While data files in this archive can be used 
   'as is' with SPICE toolkits for the majority of supported environments, 
   converting the files to the binary or text format native to the user's 
   computer may be required for use of the data with FORTRAN toolkits on 
   incompatible environments. Refer to the documentation provided with the 
   SPICE Toolkit to find out whether conversion is needed in each specific 
   case.

   NAIF provides a tool (BINGO) that can convert either binary or text
   kernels from one format to another. This means that text files can
   have their line terminator changed and binary files can be converted
   to the native format of the platform of interest. BINGO is available
   from the utilities page at the NAIF Node of the PDS:
