Orientation constants for asteroid Bennu
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The inertial reference frame for these constants is J2000; this is
   the default reference frame for PCK orientation data.
 
   The epoch of the constants is J2000; this is Julian ephemeris date
   (JED) 2451545.0.
 
   The NAIF integer code for Bennu is 2101955. See the NAIF_IDs
   required reading for further information on NAIF integer codes.

   These Bennu orientation and size constants are provided in the
   keywords below. The pole rates are provided in degrees/Julian Century.
   The rotation rate (W1) was derived from the period and is provided in 
   degrees/day. The radii are 1/2s of the polar and equatorial dimensions 
   provided in kilometers.

   The LONG_AXIS keyword providing the offset between the longest axis
   of the triaxial ellipsoid used to model Bennu and the Bennu prime
   meridian is not used by SPICE geometry software. It is considered 
   deprecated and provided solely for backwards compatibility.

   Estimated Parameter Uncertainties: 
      Solution Epoch   : 31-DEC-2018 00:00:00.000000 ET
      WPL2101955       : 1.135E-03  (deg)


   Estimated Parameters are mapped back to J2000.
