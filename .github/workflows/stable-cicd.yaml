# 🏃‍♀️ Continuous Integration and Delivery: Stable
# ===============================================
#
# Note: for this workflow to succeed, the following secrets must be installed
# in the repository:
#
# ``ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN``
#     A personal access token of a user with collaborator or better access to
#     the project repository. You can generate this by visiting GitHub →
#     Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new
#     token. Give the token scopes on ``repo``, ``write:packages``,
#     ``delete:packages``, ``workflow``, and ``read:gpg_key``.
# ``CODE_SIGNING_KEY``
#     A *private* key with which we can sign artifacts.
# ``OSSRH_USERNAME``
#     Username for the Central Repository.
# ``OSSRH_USERNAME``
#     Password for the Central Repository.

# Driving Event
# -------------
#
# What event starts this workflow: a push of a release tag. Note: according to
# https://git.io/JJZQt we have been doing our tag matching wrong. It's not
# regexp, it's not glob…it's more like…glob++ 😮
